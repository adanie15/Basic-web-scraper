Student Interview: Sarah + Zac on Company Projects,/blog/student-interview-sarah-zac,2018-12-18,"At Rithm, we believe that one of the best ways to prepare students for jobs as web developers is by giving them opportunities to work on real-world projects. Working on personal projects can be fun, but working in a team or on an existing code base gives students insights into the day-to-day challenges of a developer that they might not otherwise learn. Our 8th cohort is nearing the end of working on these projects, so we spoke with our students Sarah Kaplan and Zac Bennet to get their perspective on the experience."

Does Emotional Intelligence Get You Paid More in Tech?,/blog/emotional-intelligence,2018-10-03,"Until recently, many people thought the sole source of success boiled down to their intelligence (IQ).

EQ is not a steadfast metric, it’s a flexible set of skills that can be learned and improved with practice. You may be saying to yourself “but my technical skills will speak for themselves - why should I care about this?”"
